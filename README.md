# 💬 October Code Jam: NLP Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face 🤖

## 🧠 Overview

For the October Code Jam, our team explored how Al understands emotions in text using Hugging Face Transformers. We built a sentiment analysis model that classifies social media posts as positive, negative, or netural. 

We started with pretrained transformer models, compared their performance, and visualized how sentiment trends appear across datasets. In the final phase, we applied the best model to a creative dataset to see how sentiment shifits in read-world text. 

## 🎯 What We Did

- Used Hugging Face’s pipeline to run quick and efficient sentiment predictions.

- Compared two top-performing models: DistilBERT and RoBERTa.

- Evaluated performance with accuracy and confidence metrics.

- Visualized sentiment trends to better understand emotional tone in text.

- Applied the model to a custom dataset for creative analysis.

## ⚙️ Tools We Used

`Python`, `Hugging Face Transformers`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Scikit-learn`
